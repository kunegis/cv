% Citations of Jérôme KUNEGIS available through the convenient
% \citek{...} command, where '...' refers to the Bibtex ID of one of
% Jérôme's papers, as used in the file 'kunegis.bib'. 
%
% This does not use Bibtex, but instead will use the number that is used
% in Jérôme's CV.  As a result, you can cite Jérôme's papers and
% conveniently attach his CV to your publication.  Mostly used for
% project proposals, research statements, and similar texts by Jérôme
% himself. 
%
% HOW TO USE
%
% Step (1):  put \usepackage{ifthen} in your Latex file
% Step (2):  use a command such as \citek{kunegis:slashdot-zoo} to cite
%            a paper of Jérôme. 
% Step (3):  attach Jérôme's CV to your publication
